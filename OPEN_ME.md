  + Download the data by opening the terminal in jupyter and running the following command:
    ```
    bash download_data.sh
    ```
    This will take some time. The end result is a new folder named 'data' appearing.  
    Within it, there should be 4 subfolders, pretrained_model, testing, validation, and training.

* 4:00 - 7:00p Dataiku for Solving Prediction Problems
  + Location: Rawl Engineering Practice Facility, Room 200
